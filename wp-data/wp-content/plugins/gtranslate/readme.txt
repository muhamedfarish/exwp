Free vesion is a nice looking language selector you can place on your website. It has a built in Javascript engine which allows to translate your website automatically to multiple languages. With free version your website URL doesn't change and the translations are not stored. While paid versions are a translation proxy also known as Translation Delivery Network. We host the translated versions of your website on our cloud network under a language specific domain. In that case every language will have a separate domain and be indexed in search engines, which will help you to increase international traffic and sales.

= What is a Translation Delivery Network? =
Translation Delivery Network is a translation proxy which mirrors your website in different languages.

GTranslate TDN technology is a cloud-based approach to the website translation task. There is no need to alter your environment and install software to localize your website. You can have your multilingual website up and running in less than 5 minutes.

We will translate your content and host your translations in our cloud network. All the visits to your translated versions will be proxied through our network to your original website, so you will have a translated mirror of your website.

= How Translation Delivery Network works? =
You just need to change your DNS records to add sub-domains or domains dedicated to your languages to our Translation Delivery Network.

So when someone visits the new added sub-domain it will show the translated clone of your website.

After that you can just configure and place the GTranslate Free widget on your site to enable language selection.

= What are the server requirements? =
There are no server requirements! Your website can be written in any programming language and hosted on any web server.

= What about updates? =
Updates are done seamlessly. Since the translations are hosted on our server we take care about updates. You just use up to date service every day.

If you decide to cancel during the trial period you will not be charged anything.

= Do I need to pay for Google Translate API key usage? =
No, we provide the automatic translations for free.

= Can I test before making a payment? =
Yes, we have a 15 days free trial for our new customers.

= Can I use it on SSL / HTTPS website? =
Absolutely! By default we provide a self signed certificate, but if you want we can setup verified certificate purchased by you.

= Can I exclude some parts from being translated? =
Yes, you need to wrap the text you don't want to be translated with &lt;span class="notranslate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. You can add class="nturl" to the "a" tag if you don't want the destination URL to contain the language code.

= How does the 15 day free trial work? =
Trial is available for new customers only. If you do not wish to continue you may cancel any time during the trial period and you will not be charged anything.

= How can I be sure that search engines will index my website? =
You can check that this website is indexed in Google by searching for site:gtranslate.io.

= How I can edit the translations or order professional human translations? =
You need to go to the language you want to edit, for instance, French: http://domain.com/fr/ and add ?language_edit=1 to the end of the URL: http://domain.com/fr/?language_edit=1 and you will see the Edit and Add to Cart buttons near each text.
